# Lotto Number Generator Blueprint

## Overview
A modern, web-based Lotto Number Generator that provides a visually engaging experience for generating random lottery numbers.

## Features
- **Random Generation**: Generates 6 unique numbers between 1 and 45.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with a focus on aesthetics (gradients, shadows, and animations).
- **Theme Switching**: Support for both Dark and Light modes with persistent storage.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Visual animations when numbers are generated to simulate a "rolling" effect.
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Outline
### Version 1.1 (Current)
- **Theme Engine**: Implemented a CSS variable-based theme system for Dark/Light modes.
- **Persistence**: Remembers user theme preference using `localStorage`.
- **Framework-less Web App**: Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Uses `backdrop-filter` and `oklch` colors for a premium feel.

## Completed Steps
1.  **Structure (index.html)**: Container and theme toggle button setup.
2.  **Aesthetics (style.css)**: Theme-aware variables and smooth transitions.
3.  **Logic (main.js)**: Theme toggle functionality and localStorage integration.
4.  **Deployment**: Pushed updated version to GitHub.
